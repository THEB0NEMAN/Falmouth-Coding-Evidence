# Falmouth-Coding-Evidence
A short collection of scripts from my game that I am developing. They were created using C#, with the Visual Studio 2019 IDE, as well as the Unity Game Engine.
# EnemyAI.cs
This is the script of the pathfinding that an enemy type from my game will be using. It uses the A* pathfinding algorithm in order to locate and pursue the player
character. Below you can find video evidence of it functioning.

# PlayerMovement.cs
This is the code that allows the main character to be controlled by the player, as well as what orchestrates collision, and various physics calculations. Below you can find video evidence of it functioning.

# SettingsMenu.cs
Here you can find the code for a small excerpt of my main menu, it is what allows the player to customise various aspects of the game to set their hardware and personal preferences.
