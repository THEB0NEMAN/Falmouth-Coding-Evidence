# Falmouth-Coding-Evidence
A short collection of scripts from my game that I am developing. They were created using C#, with the Visual Studio 2019 IDE, as well as the Unity Game Engine.
# "EnemyAI.cs"
This is the script of the pathfinding that an enemy type from my game will be using. It uses the A* pathfinding algorithm in order to locate and pursue the player
character. Below you can find video evidence of it functioning.
